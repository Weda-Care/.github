# WedaCare â€“ Flexible Healthcare Staffing Platform
Branch Structure Setup:

Protect main and dev branches:
-Require PRs before merge.
-Require code reviews.

Define Branch Naming Convention:

Document naming standards
-dev/feature/WC-BE-[task-name]
-dev/feature/WC-FE-[task-name]
-dev/bugfix/WC-QA-[issue-description]

Notes:
Keep main clean for production-ready deploys.
All work should be branched from dev.
Avoid pushing directly to main branch
